# Auth0 Integration in Streamlit - Code Documentation

This documentation provides detailed explanations for each line of code in the provided script, which integrates Auth0 authentication in a Streamlit application.

### Imports and Setup

```python
from auth0_component import login_button
```
- This line imports the `login_button` function from a module named `auth0_component`. This function is likely a custom component for integrating Auth0 login functionality.

```python
import streamlit as st
```
- Here we import the Streamlit library, which is a powerful tool for creating web applications in Python, and we alias it as `st` for convenience.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```
- We import the `load_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` module, which is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

```python
import os
```
- The `os` module is imported to interact with the operating system, particularly to retrieve environment variables.

### Page Configuration and Style Hiding

```python
st.set_page_config(
    page_title=("Auth0 Example"),
    initial_sidebar_state=st.session_state.sidebar_state
)
```
- This line sets the configuration for the Streamlit page, setting the title to "Auth0 Example" and initializing the sidebar state based on the current session state.

```python
hide_st_style = """
            <style>
            #MainMenu {visibility: visable;}
            footer {visibility: hidden;}
            </style>
            """
```
- We define a multiline string containing CSS styles that will hide the Streamlit footer and ensure the main menu is visible.

```python
st.markdown(hide_st_style, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```
- Streamlit's `markdown` function is used to inject raw HTML/CSS into the page, with `unsafe_allow_html=True` allowing the use of HTML tags.

### Loading Environment Variables

```python
load_dotenv()
```
- Calls the `load_dotenv` function to load the environment variables from the `.env` file.

```python
clientId = os.environ['clientid']
domain = os.environ['domainid']
```
- Retrieves the `clientid` and `domainid` values from the environment variables and stores them in `clientId` and `domain` variables, respectively.

### Main Function Definition

```python
def main():
    st.write('this is an example of auth0 in streamlit')
```
- Defines a function called `main`, which simply displays a message on the Streamlit app indicating that this is an Auth0 example.

### Session State Initialization

```python
if 'logged_in' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.logged_in = False
```
- Checks if `logged_in` is not a key in the `session_state`. If it's not present, it initializes it to `False`.

### Authentication Logic

```python
if not st.session_state.logged_in:
    user_info = login_button(clientId=clientId, domain=domain)
```
- If the user is not logged in (`logged_in` is `False`), the `login_button` function is called with `clientId` and `domain` passed as arguments. The function returns user information, which is stored in `user_info`.

```python
    if user_info:
        st.session_state.logged_in = True
        st.rerun()
        main()
```
- If `user_info` is not `None` (indicating a successful login), the `logged_in` state is set to `True`, the app is rerun to update the state, and the `main` function is called to display the main content.

```python
elif st.session_state.user_id:
    main()
```
- Alternatively, if there is a `user_id` key in `session_state` (implying the user is already logged in), the `main` function is called directly to display the main content.

This script showcases how to set up basic Auth0 authentication in a Streamlit app, ensuring that content is only displayed to users who are logged in.
```

This README provides an explanation for every line of code in the given script. It would typically accompany the script in a repository or as part of the documentation to help developers understand how the Auth0 integration works within a Streamlit application.
